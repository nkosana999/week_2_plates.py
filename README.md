# Vanity Plates
This is a program that prompts the user for a vanity plate and then output Valid if meets all of the requirements or Invalid if it does not.

## My notes:
I am stuck, code runs without any tracebacks but there are bugs that cause misjudgements of some plates. I think my issue has more to do with the bottom conditionals of my structure though I can not really pinpoint exactly how.
But also working in this came with challanges that introduced me to (.isalpha()) and the (.isdigit()) methods which I will really need often in data manipulation, especially when processing strings.

I think now my problem besides farmilarity with syntax is structure. If I could get better at packing my code in a neat detailed stucture, debuging would get simpler even also creation would be.
